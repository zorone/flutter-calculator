The pubspec.yaml file specifies basic information about your app, such as its current version, its dependencies, and the assets with which it will ship.

Note: If you gave your app a name other than namer_app, you need to change the first line correspondingly.

Next, open another configuration file in the project, analysis_options.yaml.

Replace its contents with the following:

analysis_options.yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    prefer_const_constructors: false
    prefer_final_fields: false
    use_key_in_widget_constructors: false
    prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables: false
    prefer_const_constructors_in_immutables: false
    avoid_print: false
This file determines how strict Flutter should be when analyzing your code. Since this is your first foray into Flutter, you're telling the analyzer to take it easy. You can always tune this later. In fact, as you get closer to publishing an actual production app, you will almost certainly want to make the analyzer stricter than this.

Finally, open the main.dart file under the lib/ directory.

Replace the contents of this file with the following:

lib/main.dart
import 'package:english_words/english_words.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => MyAppState(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Namer App',
        theme: ThemeData(
          useMaterial3: true,
          colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepOrange),
        ),
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyAppState extends ChangeNotifier {
  var current = WordPair.random();
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    var appState = context.watch<MyAppState>();

    return Scaffold(
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Text('A random idea:'),
          Text(appState.current.asLowerCase),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
These 50 lines of code are the entirety of the app so far.

Note: This codelab is racing ahead to a point where you can start interactively changing the appâ€”because that's the best way to learn Flutter. If you're missing an explanation of the code above, please be patient: it's coming.

In the next section, run the application in debug mode and start developing.
